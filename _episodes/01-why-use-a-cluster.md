teaching: 10
exercises: 0
questions:
  - "Why would HPC be important to my work?"
  - "What will I learn from this course?"
objectives:
  - "Understand how a HPC system can benefit you"
keypoints:
  - "High Performance Computing (HPC) involves connecting to large computing systems elsewhere in the world"
  - "HPCs typically have thousands to hundreds of thousands of cores"
  - "HPCs have the ability to perform calculations and run simulations that would be impossible on normal machines"

## Overview

- A HPC cluster is a collection of 'computers' called nodes, all inter connected. Considerably more powerful then just one computer, like your laptop.

- Just for scale - your laptop typically has 8 cores. Kay has 40 cores PER node and has 336 'normal' compute nodes.

- Once connected you can avail of the computation power and run scirpts too heavy to run on your own computer.

- There are different types of nodes; login nodes, general compute nodes, high memory nodes, and gpu nodes.
